                 draft-lear-teap-config-options-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new Tunneled Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (TEAP) Type-Length-Value (TLV) to encapsulate DHCPv6
   (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version 6) options within TEAP
   authentication exchanges.  This enhancement enables exchange of
   network configuration parameters after the authentication phase.

1.  Introduction

   TEAP (Tunneled Extensible Authentication Protocol), defined in
   [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc7170bis], supports the use of Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) structures to exchange additional data during the
   authentication process.  DHCPv6 [RFC8415] is widely used for
   configuration of network parameters.  This document introduces a new
   TLV to encapsulate DHCPv6 options within TEAP messages.

   [RFC9445] specifies a way to communicate DHCPv6 options to a RADIUS
   client.  This memo specifies a means to communicate options end-to-
   end between the authentication server and the peer.

   Not all DHCP communications will necessarily make sense in this
   context.  For instance, an AAA server may only wish to send non-
   topological options, such as a definitions for a print server, or
   next hop configuration URL.  It might not send next-hop router or IP
   address binding information.

   Sending options in a protected and authenticated TLS tunnel also
   authenticates the options, and allows them to be transmitted securely
   from the authentication server to the peer.  While [RFC8415],
   Section 20 provides for authentication of DHCP messages, this feature
   is not always used.  Even if the DHCP messages are authenticated,
   there are still benefits to sending options inside of a protected
   TEAP session.

1.1.  Use of both DHCPv6 and TEAP protocols

   Because DHCPv6 is widely deployed, peers implementing this
   specification can expect to receive information via both TEAP and
   DHCPv6.  Therefore, the possibility of a conflict arises.  Clients
   are not in a good position to determine on their own which
   information is correct.  Therefore, the following strategy is
   RECOMMENDED:

   1.  Peers receiving information only via DHCP will use that
       information.

   2.  Peers receiving DHCP information only via TEAP will use that
       information.

   3.  Peers receiving overlapping DHCPv6 options SHOULD select TEAP
       information since it is likely to be better authenticated and
       unchanged.

   4.  If conflicting information is received by the peer it SHOULD log
       the conflict as an error and MAY produce an exception.

   In practice, these rules can be applied by a peer initializing a
   result option list by using the options which are received from TEAP,
   and then selectively adding options from DHCP.  Before adding a DHCP
   option, the peer checks (by number) if the option already exists in
   the result option list.  If no matching option exists, it is added.
   If a matching option exists, the values are compared, and a log
   message can be generated.

   It is RECOMMENDED that conflict be avoided by having the DHCP server
   send options which control network behavior (address assignment,
   routes, etc).  The TEAP server can then send options which require
   the peer to follow a particular policy.  The detailed list of which
   options fall into which category is site-specific, and out of scope
   of this specification.

2.  TEAP TLV for DHCPv6 Options

   DHCPv6 options are carried within the DHCPv6-Options TLV.  The TLV
   format is defined below.

   Both the TEAP server and TEAP client MAY transmit this TLV during
   Phase 2, and it MAY be included in a Request Action frame.  The
   Mandatory bit MUST not be set.  If either side sends this TLV prior
   to Phase 2, an error TLV of 2002 (Unexpected TLVs Exchanged) be
   returned with a Result of Status=Failure.  That is, the table in
   Section 4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc7170bis] remains unchanged.

   Thus this TLV MAY be used as follows:

        +=========+==========+=========+=========+================+
        | Request | Response | Success | Failure | TLV            |
        +=========+==========+=========+=========+================+
        | 0-1     | 0-1      | 0-1     | 0       | DHCPv6-Options |
        +---------+----------+---------+---------+----------------+

                     Table 1: When is this TLV Allowed

   A TEAP peer or server receiving this TLV SHOULD NOT act on it until
   the other side has been sufficiently authenticated, but it is not an
   error to send this TLV in advance of such authentication.  In this
   way, the TLV can be conveniently piggybacked as part of the
   authentication prior to a result or intermediate result being
   generated.

2.1.  TLV Format

   The DHCPv6-Options TLV follows the TEAP TLV format from
   [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc7170bis], Section 4.2.1, and is defined below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |M|R|         TLV Type          |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           DHCPv6 options...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

      M

      TLV Type

         TBD - DHCPv6 options

      DHCPv6 options

         This field MUST contain DHCPv6 options, as defined in
         {{RFC8415, Section 21.1}}.

2.1.1.  DHCPv6 Option Encapsulation

   The TLV Value field encapsulates DHCPv6 options exactly as they
   appear in DHCPv6 messages.  There MUST NOT be more than one
   DHCPv6-Options TLV in a TEAP exchange.  The TEAP TLV format is
   sufficient to carry any number of DHCPv6 options which may be needed.

   A party which receives multiple DHCPv6-Options TLVs during a TEAP
   exchange SHOULD process only the first such option, and then ignore
   all remaining ones.

   The format adheres to the standard DHCPv6 option encoding, ensuring
   compatibility with existing DHCPv6 implementations.

   Encapsulating this option in the TLV would look as follows (in
   hexadecimal):

   Type: 0xXXXX (TBD assigned by IANA)
   Length: 0x0014
   Value: 0x00170010FE8000000000000000000000000001

   Where:

   *  Type = 0xXXXX (TBD assigned by IANA)

   *  Length = 0x0014 (20 bytes for the "Recursive DNS Servers" option,
      including addresses)

   *  Value = 0x00170010FE8000000000000000000000000001 (DHCPv6 Option 23
      with an IPv6 address of FE80::1).

3.  Security Considerations

   Encapsulating DHCPv6 options within TEAP messages inherits the
   security guarantees of the TEAP protocol.  Further details on
   mitigation strategies are discussed in [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc7170bis].

   Sending DHCPv6 options withing a protected and authenticated TLS
   tunnel provides for additional authentication of those options, and
   for exchanging the options in a secure manner.  While DHCPv6 provides
   for message authentication, that functionality is not always
   available.

   This feature also enables better separation of responsibilities.  A
   DHCPv6 server can simply manage address assignment and network
   configuration.  The TEAP authentication server can then manage higher
   level network policies.

3.1.  Additional Policy Decisions

   DHCP clients can send options which indicate their desired network
   posture.  An authentication server can then make policy decisions
   based on the options, such as placing the device into a different
   VLAN.

3.2.  Captive Portals and Provisioning

   TEAP provides for unauthenticated access for provisioning.  The
   DHCPv6-Options TLV can be used within a provisioning network without
   issue.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new TEAP TLV type value for the DHCPv6
   Options TLV from the TEAP TLV Type registry defined in
   [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc7170bis].
