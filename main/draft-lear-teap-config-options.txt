             New TEAP TLV for Encapsulating DHCPv6 Options
                 draft-lear-teap-config-options-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new Tunneled Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (TEAP) Type-Length-Value (TLV) to encapsulate DHCPv6
   (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version 6) options within TEAP
   authentication exchanges.  This enhancement enables exchange of
   network configuration parameters after the authentication phase.

1.  Introduction

   TEAP (Tunneled Extensible Authentication Protocol), defined in
   [RFC7170], supports the use of Type-Length-Value (TLV) structures to
   exchange additional data during the authentication process.  DHCPv6
   [RFC8415] is widely used for configuration of network parameters.
   This document introduces a new TLV to encapsulate DHCPv6 options
   within TEAP messages.

   [RFC9445] specifies a way to communicate options to a radius client.
   This memo specifies a means to communicate options end-to-end between
   the authentication server and the peer.

   Not all DHCP communications will necessarily make sense in this
   context.  For instance, a AAA server may only wish to send non-
   topological options, such as a print server, or next hop
   configuration URL, and it might not send next-hop router or IP
   address binding information.

1.1.  Use of both DHCPv6 and TEAP protocols

   Because DHCPv6 is widely deployed, peers implementing this
   specifciation can expect to receive information via TEAP and DHCPv6.
   Thereefore, the possibility of a conflict arises.  Clients are not in
   a good position to determine on their own which information is
   correct.  Therefore, the following strategy is RECOMMENDED:

   1.  Peers receiving information only via DHCP will use that
       information.

   2.  Peers receiving DHCP information only via TEAP will use that
       information.

   3.  Peers receiving overlapping DHCPv6 options SHOULD select TEAP
       information since it is likely to be better authenticated and
       unchanged.

   4.  If conflicting information is received by the peer it SHOULD log
       the conflict as an error and MAY produce an exception.

2.  TEAP TLV for DHCPv6 Options

   Both the TEAP server and TEAP client MAY transmit this TLV during
   Phase 2, and it MAY be included in a Request Action frame.  The
   Mandatory bit MUST not be set.  If either side sends this TLV prior
   to Phase 2, an error TLV of 2002 (Unexpected TLVs Exchanged) be
   returned with a Result of Status=Failure.  That is, the table in
   Section 4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc7170bis] remains unchanged.

   Thus this TLV MAY be used as follows:

        +=========+==========+=========+=========+================+
        | Request | Response | Success | Failure | TLV            |
        +=========+==========+=========+=========+================+
        | 0+      | 0+       | 0+      | 0       | DHCPv6 options |
        +---------+----------+---------+---------+----------------+

                     Table 1: When is this TLV Allowed

   A TEAP peer or server receiving this TLV SHOULD NOT act on it until
   the other side has been sufficiently authenticated, but it is not an
   error to send this TLV in advance of such authentication.  In this
   way, the TLV can be conveniently piggybacked as part of the
   authentication prior to a result or intermediate result being
   generated.

2.1.  TLV Format

   The new TEAP TLV for DHCPv6 options is structured as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |M|R|         TLV Type          |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           DHCPv6 fields...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

                     Figure 1: DHCP options TLV format

      M

         0 - Optional TLV

      R

         Reserved, set to zero (0)

      TLV Type

         TBD - DHCPv6 options

      Length

         >=2 octets

2.2.  DHCPv6 Option Encapsulation

   The Value field encapsulates DHCPv6 options exactly as they appear in
   DHCPv6 messages.  Multiple options can be included, concatenated
   sequentially, with no padding between them.

   The format adheres to the standard DHCPv6 option encoding, ensuring
   compatibility with existing DHCPv6 implementations.

   Encapsulating this option in the TLV would look as follows (in
   hexadecimal):

   Type: 0xXXXX (assigned by IANA)
   Length: 0x0014
   Value: 0x00170010FE8000000000000000000000000001

   Where:

   *  Type = 0xXXXX (placeholder for the assigned type value)

   *  Length = 0x0014 (20 bytes for the "Recursive DNS Servers" option,
      including addresses)

   *  Value = 0x00170010FE8000000000000000000000000001 (DHCPv6 Option 23
      with an IPv6 address of FE80::1).

3.  Security Considerations

   Encapsulating DHCPv6 options within TEAP messages inherits the
   security guarantees of the TEAP protocol.  Further details on
   mitigation strategies are discussed in [RFC7170].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new TEAP TLV type value for the DHCPv6
   Options TLV from the TEAP TLV Type registry defined in [RFC7170].

   The authors hope to thank the members of the IETF EMU Working Group
   for their valuable input and contributions.
